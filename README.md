This project is for a new mobile company. The idea is to give tough fight to big companies like Apple,Samsung etc.

We will estimate price of mobiles of this new company. In this competitive mobile phone market you cannot simply assume things. To solve this problem sales data collected of mobile phones are collected from various companies.

So we can find relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM,Internal Memory etc) and its selling price.

In this problem we will not predict actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is.
